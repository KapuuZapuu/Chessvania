# Chessvania (NOT FINISHED-- Menus are incomplete, logic is unfinished and wave functionality/stockfish imports are still a WIP)
(Game details to come)

Eventually, if (and when) I do get in touch with people who are more involved in the game development space, I would like to create a more fleshed out (and visually appealing) version of chessvania. Chess as a game has not evolved at all for a very long time, and the interest in the game has been at an all time high in recent years. People in the chess content creation space would do wonders for a new take on the game-- and would be great for publicity.
