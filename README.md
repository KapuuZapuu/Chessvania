# Chessvania (NOT FINISHED-- Menus are incomplete, logic is unfinished and wave functionality/stockfish imports are still a WIP)
A unique twist on chess built entirely into the console using only Python. A Balatro-styled game where users are presented with foes more and more challenging (in terms of both ELO rating and piece strength), and must use unique piece upgrades and board powerups in order to survive.
