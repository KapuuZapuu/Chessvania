# Chessvania ***(NOT FINISHED!!!!)***

*The build you see here may be a few (or many) versions behind the current development state of the game (on my local system). As a result, what you see on this repository is probably an inaccurate reflection of the amount of progress made in actuality.*

**Currently working on:**
* Stockfish implementation
* Upgrade System
* Shop/Currency
* Visual Consistency + Polish

**Future plans:**
* Multiplayer mode (to play with your friends)
* Fantasy Piece Swaps
